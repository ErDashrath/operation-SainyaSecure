feat: Complete P2P simulation system and rebrand to Operation SainyaSecure

🚀 Major Features Added:
- ✅ Complete P2P communication system with offline-first architecture
- ✅ Real-time mode switching between Server Online and P2P Offline modes
- ✅ Advanced peer discovery with realistic signal strength simulation
- ✅ Comprehensive P2P status dashboard with live updates
- ✅ P2P message routing and blockchain logging system
- ✅ Database integration with proper sync capabilities

🔧 Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced p2p_sync app with 5 new API endpoints:
  * /p2p_sync/api/status/ - Real-time P2P status monitoring
  * /p2p_sync/api/toggle/ - Mode switching functionality
  * /p2p_sync/api/discover/ - Peer discovery with device simulation
  * /p2p_sync/api/sync/ - P2P synchronization management
  * /p2p_sync/api/send-message/ - P2P message routing

- P2P Communication Manager (p2p_comm.py):
  * Realistic peer discovery using actual device data
  * Signal strength simulation with distance calculations
  * P2P message routing with blockchain logging
  * Sync functionality for both server and P2P modes

- Dedicated P2P Management Interface:
  * Comprehensive status page at /p2p_sync/dashboard/
  * Real-time peer management table
  * P2P messaging form with priority levels
  * Network activity monitoring
  * Live connection status updates

🎨 UI/UX Improvements:
- Enhanced dashboard integration with P2P controls
- Real-time status updates with 5-second refresh intervals
- Professional military-themed interface
- Responsive peer discovery table
- Interactive mode switching with visual feedback

🔐 Infrastructure:
- Fixed blockchain migration issues
- Proper CSRF handling for all endpoints
- Enhanced error handling and fallback data
- Database optimization for P2P operations
- Comprehensive test suite with 6 test scenarios

🏷️ Rebranding:
- Complete operation rename from "TRINETRA" to "SainyaSecure"
- Updated all documentation, templates, and scripts
- Consistent branding across landing pages and API docs
- Professional GitHub-ready project structure

📊 System Capabilities:
- Toggle between centralized and decentralized modes
- Simulate 5+ peer connections with varying signal strengths
- Real-time blockchain synchronization
- Offline message queuing and delivery
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Military-grade security simulation

🧪 Testing:
- Created comprehensive P2P test suite (test_p2p_system.py)
- All API endpoints validated and functional
- Mode switching tested and verified
- Peer discovery simulation working
- Database integration confirmed
- Dashboard integration tested

📁 Project Structure:
- Ready for folder rename to "operation-SainyaSecure"
- Helper scripts created for easy project migration
- Professional naming conventions throughout
- GitHub deployment ready

This commit represents a complete transformation from basic Django app to 
a fully functional military-grade P2P communication system with real-time 
capabilities, comprehensive testing, and professional branding.
